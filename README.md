Project: sportSunday (version 1)

Hello, hello!
i am just a little (obviously not commercial) java program, trying to impress you! My design is based on
model-view-controller pattern and my GUI was made by swing API.

My job is to manage sports tournaments. I am programmed to consider that modesty isn't just for average ones but a
significant virtue. Therefore, i 'll be laconic on describing my duties and skills.    

First of all, 
for providing me the abiltity of persistent storage of your data, you should first manualy create an 
empty folder with the name "serializationFolder" at C:\. Every time that the program begins, it will load your 
data from "greekSportsObject.ser" file which is in folder: C:\serializationFolder.

My basic capabilities:

*** Competitors screen!
    
    Create teams and athletes and storage them at my "database" (i prefer serialization rather than classic DB).
    I am not a hispster. Just my creator had already done projects with classic DBs and he thought serialization is
    efficient and elegant. Because of him, i am now the weirdo kid!
    

*** Championship screen!

    Create, adjust their characteristics and manage tournaments for some sports (basketball, footbal,ping pong,
    tennis, volleyball, so far).In version 1, only two types of championships are available (cup, league) and 
    each one have got only one round. The guy that made me promised that i 'll become more flexible when i grow
    up. It sux to be a kid. Too many restrictions. 

*** Participations screen!

    Register competitors (teams or solists) to the existed championships. Easy work for you but i am the dogsbody
    behind the curtains.

*** Report screen!

    That's my fanciest talent. I provide lottery of schedule, schedule where you can register scores, statistics
    table, 4 ways of sorting the statistics table. You can change some score and after just some milliseconds
    everything has been updated. But my dad is really proud of my lottery algorithm. You should check it out
    (package: lotteryClasses),it is fully commented.
    Well, report screen is supported in this version only for basketball and football sport events. Wait for v.2!


-----> I hope that you 've noticed that i find out and fix every clumsy move of you on every screen.
       Too much code for checking dummies!

That's all for now...
